## Code Sample By Matt Troutman

This project is a simple contact book using Laravel 5, MySQL, JQuery, HTML5 and Bootstrap

- Compiled from Laravel 5 via composer
- Models, Database Migrations and Controllers were created via artisan
- Uses Socialite Authentication as a service provider
- Installed ActiveCampaign PHP API and created a custom service provider class to handle api requests
- Deployed to a clean AWS Ubuntu Server which I installed PHP 7, MySQL and Apache on
- Git is using one branch since this is a single developer application
- Live Demo: http://codesample.outofsite4you.com
- Note: Active campaign uses one contact list therefore no duplicate emails are allowed in the database no matter what user id they are created with

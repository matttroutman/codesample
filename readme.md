## Code Sample By Matt Troutman

This project was compiled from Laravel 5

- Installation was done via composer
- Models, Database Migrations and Controllers were created via artisan
- Application is a simple contact book
- Uses Socialite Authentication as a service provider
- Installed ActiveCampaign PHP API and created a custom service provider class to handle api requests
- Deployed to a clean AWS Ubuntu Server which I installed PHP 7, MySQL and Apache on
- Live Demo: http://codesample.outofsite4you.com
- Note: Active campaign uses one contact list therefore no duplicate emails are allowed in the database no matter what user id they are created with
